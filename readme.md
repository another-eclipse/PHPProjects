This is my Random Number Generator project. Made on 5th of December, 2021. by Valentina (another_eclipse).
Done in Atom using PHP, HTML and CSS.
I'm a newbie and this is my first project so I would appreciate if you could
  provide some advice on my code. See details below.
Some problems I'd like to work on (but couldn't figure them out by myself during this project):
  - how to retain numbers in input so that people wouldn't have to enter the same values every time
    (e.g. retain 4 20D dice and just keep generating, without having to select them again)
  - how to arrange PHP results in for loops into a grid in HTML. I know the theory, but results just kept being in a clump.

  If you can provide solutions for the abovementioned struggles, please do! Also, if you have any other suggestions, let me know.
